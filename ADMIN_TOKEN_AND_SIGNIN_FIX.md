# URGENT FIXES - Admin Token & Sign-In Redirect Issues

## Date: October 3, 2025

---

## 🚨 ISSUE 1: "Error: Unauthorized" in User Management

### Problem
Admin panel shows "Error: Unauthorized" when trying to fetch users from Clerk.

### Root Cause
**Admin JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes** for security. Your session has expired.

### Solution Applied
Enhanced error handling to detect expired tokens and auto-redirect to login:

```typescript
if (response.status === 401) {
  // Token expired or invalid
  setUserError('Your admin session has expired. Redirecting to login...')
  localStorage.removeItem('admin_token')
  localStorage.removeItem('admin')
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = '/admin/login'
  }, 2000)
}
```

### ✅ How to Fix RIGHT NOW:

#### Option 1: Re-login to Admin Panel (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. You'll get a fresh 15-minute token
4. User Management will work again ✅
```

#### Option 2: Clear Browser Storage (if stuck)
```bash
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. Click "Local Storage" → "http://localhost:3000"
4. Delete these items:
   - admin_token
   - admin
5. Refresh page
6. Login again at /admin/login
```

## 🚨 ISSUE 2: Sign-In Still Redirects to Marketing Page

### Problem
After signing in from client side, still redirecting to marketing page instead of `/app`.

### Root Cause
**Browser cache** is serving old JavaScript files with the old redirect logic.

### Files Already Fixed
✅ `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Updated to redirect to `/app`
✅ `app/sign-up/page.tsx` - Updated to redirect to `/app`
✅ `app/page.tsx` - Already redirects authenticated users to `/app`

### ✅ How to Fix RIGHT NOW:

#### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```bash
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R (or Ctrl + F5)
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

#### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (if hard refresh doesn't work)
```bash
Chrome/Edge:
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Select "All time"
4. Click "Clear data"

Firefox:
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Check "Cache"
3. Click "Clear Now"
```

#### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
# In your terminal:
1. Stop the server (Ctrl + C)
2. Delete .next folder: rd /s /q .next
3. Restart: npm run dev
```

#### Step 4: Test Sign-In Flow
```bash
1. Sign out from client side
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
3. Go to: http://localhost:3000/sign-in
4. Sign in with your credentials
5. Should redirect to: http://localhost:3000/app ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Admin Token Lifecycle

```
Login → Generate JWT Token (expires in 15 min) → Store in localStorage
   ↓
Use token for API requests
   ↓
Token expires after 15 min → 401 Unauthorized
   ↓
Auto-redirect to /admin/login → Login again → New token ✅
```

### Sign-In Redirect Flow

```
User enters credentials → Clerk authenticates → Sign-in success
   ↓
NEW CODE: router.push('/app')  ✅
OLD CODE: router.push('/')     ❌ (cached in browser)
   ↓
Must clear cache to get new code
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Check Admin Token in Console:
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
console.log('Admin Token:', localStorage.getItem('admin_token'))
console.log('Admin Data:', localStorage.getItem('admin'))

// If null or very old, login again
```

### Check Sign-In Redirect:
```javascript
// Add this in sign-in page console:
console.log('After sign-in, redirecting to:', '/app')

// If it says '/' instead of '/app', cache issue
```

### Force Cache Bypass:
```bash
# Add version parameter to force reload
http://localhost:3000/sign-in?v=2
```

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

### If Admin "Unauthorized" persists:
1. Check `.env` file has `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` set
2. Check admin credentials are correct
3. Check MongoDB has admin user created
4. Check console for detailed error logs

### If Sign-In redirect persists:
1. Try incognito/private browsing mode
2. Try different browser
3. Delete .next folder completely
4. Restart computer (clears all caches)
5. Check network tab - are old .js files loading?
