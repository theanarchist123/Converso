# Banned User Redirect Fix

## Issue Reported
**Date**: October 3, 2025

### Problem
User is banned, but when clicking "Get Started" or "Start Learning Now" buttons on marketing page, they were redirected to `/sign-in` page instead of `/banned` page.

**Expected Behavior**: Banned users should ONLY see the `/banned` page, no matter what link they click.

**Actual Behavior**: Middleware was checking public routes first, allowing banned users to access sign-in/sign-up pages.

---

## Root Cause

### Old Middleware Logic (WRONG):
```typescript
// ❌ This allowed banned users to access sign-in
if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
  return NextResponse.next()  // Sign-in is public, so allowed!
}

// Ban check happened AFTER public route check
if (userId && sessionClaims) {
  if (user.banned === true) {
    // Only blocked /app routes, not sign-in
  }
}
```

**Problem**: 
1. Middleware checked if route is public FIRST
2. Sign-in/sign-up are public routes
3. Banned users were allowed to access them
4. Ban check only happened for `/app` routes

---

## Solution

### New Middleware Logic (CORRECT):
```typescript
// ✅ Check ban status FIRST, before anything else
if (userId && sessionClaims) {
  const isBanned = user.banned === true || user.publicMetadata?.status === 'banned'
  
  if (isBanned) {
    // Allow ONLY /banned page
    if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/banned') {
      return NextResponse.next()
    }
    
    // Block EVERYTHING else, redirect to /banned
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/banned', req.url))
  }
}

// Public route check happens AFTER ban check
if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

**Fix**:
1. Check ban status FIRST (before public routes)
2. If banned: Block ALL routes except `/banned`
3. Redirect banned users to `/banned` no matter where they try to go
4. Public route check only applies to non-banned users

## What Changed

### File Modified
**Location**: `middleware.ts`

### Before (Lines 14-41):
```typescript
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const { userId, sessionClaims } = await auth();
  
  // Allow access to public routes (CHECKED FIRST - WRONG!)
  if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  
  // Ban check happened AFTER public routes
  if (userId && sessionClaims) {
    const user = sessionClaims as any;
    if (user.banned === true) {
      // Only blocked /app routes
      if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/app')) {
        return NextResponse.redirect('/banned')
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### After (Lines 14-41):
```typescript
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const { userId, sessionClaims } = await auth();
  
  // Check ban status FIRST (before anything else)
  if (userId && sessionClaims) {
    const user = sessionClaims as any;
    const isBanned = user.banned === true || user.publicMetadata?.status === 'banned';
    
    if (isBanned) {
      // Allow ONLY /banned page
      if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/banned') {
        return NextResponse.next();
      }
      
      // Block EVERYTHING else
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/banned', req.url));
    }
  }
  
  // Public routes allowed AFTER ban check
  if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
})
```

## User Flow (After Fix)

### Scenario: Banned User Clicks "Get Started"

```
Step 1: User on marketing page (/)
   ↓
Step 2: Clicks "Get Started" button
   ↓
Step 3: Button tries to redirect to /sign-in
   ↓
Step 4: Middleware intercepts request
   ↓
Step 5: Checks authentication: User is logged in
   ↓
Step 6: Checks ban status FIRST: User is banned ❌
   ↓
Step 7: Checks destination: Not /banned
   ↓
Step 8: BLOCKS /sign-in redirect
   ↓
Step 9: Forces redirect to /banned ✅
   ↓
Step 10: User sees "Account Banned" page
   ↓
Step 11: Can only contact support or sign out
```

### Scenario: Banned User Tries Any Link

```
Banned user tries to access:
├── / (homepage) → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /marketing → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /sign-in → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /sign-up → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /app → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /app/companions → Redirected to /banned ✅
├── /app/session-history → Redirected to /banned ✅
└── /banned → Allowed ✅ (can see ban message)
```

---

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Get Started Button
```bash
SETUP: User is banned and logged in

STEPS:
1. Go to marketing page (/)
2. Click "Get Started" button
3. Should redirect to /banned (NOT /sign-in)

RESULT: ✅ PASS
- Redirects to /banned immediately
- Shows "Account Banned" message
- Cannot access sign-in page
```

### Test 2: Direct URL Access
```bash
SETUP: User is banned and logged in

STEPS:
1. Try to manually go to /sign-in
2. Try to manually go to /app
3. Try to manually go to /marketing

RESULT: ✅ PASS
- All URLs redirect to /banned
- User cannot access any page except /banned
- Clear ban message shown
```

### Test 3: Non-Banned User
```bash
SETUP: User is NOT banned

STEPS:
1. Click "Get Started" button
2. Should go to /sign-in normally

RESULT: ✅ PASS
- Redirects to /sign-in correctly
- Can sign in and access app
- No interference from ban check
```

## Routes Blocked for Banned Users

| Route | Before Fix | After Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `/` (Homepage) | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked → /banned |
| `/marketing` | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked → /banned |
| `/sign-in` | ✅ Allowed ⚠️ | ❌ Blocked → /banned |
| `/sign-up` | ✅ Allowed ⚠️ | ❌ Blocked → /banned |
| `/app/*` | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked → /banned |
| `/banned` | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |

**Key Change**: Sign-in and sign-up now blocked for banned users!

---

## Technical Details

### Ban Check Order

**Old (WRONG)**:
```
1. Check if route is public → Allow
2. Check if user is banned → Maybe block
3. Result: Banned users could access sign-in
```

**New (CORRECT)**:
```
1. Check if user is banned → Block everything except /banned
2. Check if route is public → Allow for non-banned users
3. Result: Banned users can ONLY see /banned
```

### Double Ban Check

The middleware now checks BOTH ban indicators:
```typescript
const isBanned = 
  user.banned === true ||  // Clerk's native ban flag
  user.publicMetadata?.status === 'banned'  // Our custom metadata
```

This ensures banned users are caught even if one method fails.

---

## Security Improvements

### Before Fix
⚠️ Banned users could:
- Access sign-in page
- Access sign-up page
- See marketing content
- Click "Get Started" buttons

### After Fix
✅ Banned users can ONLY:
- View `/banned` page
- See ban reason
- Contact support
- Sign out

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Banned User Bookmarked Sign-In
```
User has /sign-in bookmarked
   ↓
Clicks bookmark
   ↓
Middleware redirects to /banned ✅
```

### Case 2: Banned User Uses Direct URL
```
User types /app in address bar
   ↓
Middleware redirects to /banned ✅
```

### Case 3: Banned User Clicks Email Link
```
User clicks password reset link → /sign-in?reset=true
   ↓
Middleware redirects to /banned ✅
```

### Case 4: Non-Banned User Navigation
```
Normal user clicks "Get Started"
   ↓
Ban check: Not banned
   ↓
Public route check: /sign-in is public
   ↓
Allowed to access /sign-in ✅
```

## Summary

### Issue
✅ **FIXED**: Banned users can no longer access sign-in/sign-up pages

### Root Cause
❌ Middleware checked public routes before ban status

### Solution
✅ Reordered checks: Ban status checked FIRST, before everything else

### Impact
🔒 **High Security**: Banned users now completely locked out (only see /banned page)

### Files Modified
- `middleware.ts` - Reordered ban check to happen first

### Testing
✅ All scenarios pass:
- Get Started button → /banned
- Direct URL access → /banned
- Bookmarked links → /banned
- Normal users → Works correctly

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Impact**: Critical security improvement for user management
