# Gemini AI Integration for Session Recaps

This document explains how Gemini AI is integrated into the session recap feature to generate intelligent, educational summaries of learning sessions.

## Overview

The application now uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze conversation transcripts between students and AI companions, generating comprehensive recaps that include:
- **Bullet Points**: Key learning concepts and insights from the session
- **Key Topics**: Main subjects discussed during the conversation
- **Summary**: A concise overview of the learning session and outcomes

## Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
Add your Gemini API key to the `.env.local` file:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 2. Dependencies
The integration uses the official Google Generative AI package:
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

## Implementation

### Core Files
- **`lib/gemini.ts`** - Main Gemini integration logic
- **`app/api/session/recap/route.ts`** - Updated recap endpoint using Gemini
- **`app/api/test-gemini/route.ts`** - Test endpoint (can be removed in production)

### Key Features

#### 1. Intelligent Content Analysis
Gemini analyzes the full conversation context to extract meaningful educational content, understanding:
- Learning objectives and outcomes
- Key concepts and definitions
- Problem-solving discussions
- Practical applications

#### 2. Structured Output
The AI generates consistent, structured responses with:
- 5-8 detailed bullet points highlighting key learning moments
- 3-5 main topics covered in the session
- A comprehensive 2-3 sentence summary

#### 3. Fallback Mechanism
If Gemini is unavailable or returns invalid responses, the system automatically falls back to a basic extraction method to ensure the feature always works.

#### 4. Error Handling
Robust error handling includes:
- API key validation
- Response format validation
- Network error handling
- JSON parsing error recovery

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { generateSessionRecap } from '@/lib/gemini';

const recap = await generateSessionRecap(
    messages,           // Array of conversation messages
    companionName,      // Name of the AI companion
    subject,           // Subject area (e.g., "science")
    topic              // Specific topic (e.g., "photosynthesis")
);

// Returns:
// {
//   bullet_points: string[],
//   key_topics: string[],
//   summary: string
// }
```

## API Response Format

The Gemini integration returns educational recaps in this format:

```json
{
  "bullet_points": [
    "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.",
    "Photosynthesis has two main stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.",
    "The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂."
  ],
  "key_topics": [
    "Photosynthesis",
    "Light-dependent reactions", 
    "Calvin cycle",
    "Chemical equations"
  ],
  "summary": "The learning session effectively covered the fundamental process of photosynthesis, detailing its two main stages and their respective functions within plant cells."
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Enhanced Learning Experience
- **Contextual Understanding**: Gemini understands the educational context and extracts relevant learning points
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Captures both explicit and implicit learning outcomes
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritizes pedagogically valuable content over casual conversation

### 2. Improved Recap Quality
- **Detailed Bullet Points**: More specific and actionable than basic text extraction
- **Relevant Topics**: AI identifies the most important concepts discussed
- **Professional Summaries**: Well-written, coherent summaries that highlight achievements

### 3. Scalable Solution
- **Subject Agnostic**: Works across all subjects (math, science, language, etc.)
- **Topic Flexible**: Adapts to any specific topic within a subject area
- **Conversation Length**: Handles both short and long conversation sessions

## Configuration Options

### Model Selection
Currently using `gemini-1.5-flash` for optimal balance of speed and quality. Can be changed in `lib/gemini.ts`:

```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash' });
```

### Prompt Customization
The prompt can be modified in `lib/gemini.ts` to adjust:
- Output format requirements
- Educational focus areas
- Content extraction priorities
- Response length and detail level

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Error Logging
All errors are logged with appropriate context:
- API connection issues
- Invalid API key errors
- JSON parsing failures
- Response validation errors

### Fallback Behavior
When Gemini fails, the system:
1. Logs the error for debugging
2. Automatically switches to basic extraction
3. Ensures users always receive a recap
4. Maintains service reliability

## Production Considerations

### 1. API Limits
- Monitor Gemini API usage and quotas
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Consider caching for frequently requested content

### 2. Cost Management
- Track API costs per session
- Optimize prompt length for efficiency
- Consider batch processing for multiple sessions

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Monitor recap quality through user feedback
- A/B test different prompt variations
- Continuously improve the prompt based on results

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Personalization**: Adapt recaps based on user learning style
2. **Progress Tracking**: Connect recaps to learning progress metrics
3. **Multi-language**: Support for conversations in different languages
4. **Visual Elements**: Generate suggested diagrams or visual aids
5. **Assessment Integration**: Include quiz questions based on session content

### Advanced Features
1. **Learning Path Suggestions**: Recommend follow-up topics based on session content
2. **Concept Mapping**: Create visual representations of learned concepts
3. **Difficulty Analysis**: Assess and report on concept difficulty levels
4. **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify areas that need additional reinforcement
