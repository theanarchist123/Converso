# URGENT: Server Restart Required

## Issue
Banned users can still access sign-in page because middleware changes haven't taken effect.

## Root Cause
**Middleware changes require a full server restart** to take effect. The dev server doesn't always hot-reload middleware changes.

## Solution

### Step 1: Stop the Development Server
```bash
# In your terminal where npm run dev is running:
Press: Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
# Delete the .next folder to clear all caches
rd /s /q .next
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Browser
```bash
# Clear browser cache
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
# Or
Press: Ctrl + F5
```

### Step 5: Test Again
```bash
1. As banned user, try to access /sign-in
2. Should now redirect to /banned
3. Check server console for logs:
   ðŸš« Banned user tried to access: /sign-in
```

---

## What to Look For

### In Server Console (Terminal):
When you try to access sign-in as a banned user, you should see:
```
ðŸš« Banned user tried to access: /sign-in
```

If you DON'T see this message, the middleware isn't running the new code.

### In Browser:
- Should redirect to `/banned` page
- URL should be: `http://localhost:3000/banned`
- Should see "Account Banned" message

---

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check if Middleware is Running
Add a test by going to any page. The server console should show middleware logs.

### 2. Check Your Ban Status
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// This will tell you if you're actually banned
fetch('/api/admin/users?limit=1', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('admin_token') }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Your user:', d))
```

### 3. Verify You're Logged In
```javascript
// Check if you have a userId
console.log('Logged in:', document.cookie.includes('__clerk'))
```

### 4. Force Clear Everything
```bash
# If still not working:
1. Stop server (Ctrl + C)
2. Delete .next folder: rd /s /q .next
3. Clear browser cache: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
4. Restart server: npm run dev
5. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
6. Try again
```

---

## Quick Commands (Copy-Paste)

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl + C), then run:
rd /s /q .next && npm run dev
```

Then in browser:
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

## If Still Not Working

### Check Clerk Session
The issue might be that Clerk's session cache is still active. Try:

1. **Sign Out Completely**
   - Click sign out
   - Clear cookies
   - Close browser
   - Reopen browser

2. **Sign In Again**
   - Your session will be fresh
   - Middleware should catch it

3. **Test Admin Ban**
   - Have admin ban your account again
   - Middleware should detect it immediately

## Expected Behavior After Server Restart

```
YOU (Banned User):
Click "Get Started" â†’ Middleware checks â†’ Banned? YES â†’ Redirect to /banned âœ…

Server Console:
ðŸš« Banned user tried to access: /sign-in

Browser:
Shows /banned page with "Account Banned" message âœ…
```

---

**TL;DR: Stop server (Ctrl+C) â†’ Delete .next folder â†’ Restart â†’ Hard refresh browser â†’ Test again**
